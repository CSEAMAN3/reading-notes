### JavaScript Canvas


1) What does the <canvas> allow a developer to acheive?

   canvas allows a developer to draw graphics via scripting. It can be used for example to draw graphs, combine photos, or create simple animations.
  
2) What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?
   It allows content to be included between the opening and closing tags. The content added between the opening and closing tag is used as fallback 
   content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the <canvas> element.

3) Explain what the getContext() method does.
   The getContext() function returns the drawing context - which is an object that has all the drawing properties and functions you use to draw on 
   the canvas.
