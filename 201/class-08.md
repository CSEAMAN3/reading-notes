### Flexbox

Flex box is a one dimensional layout mechanism for laying out groups of items.

It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

#### The main axis and the cross axis

The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.






###### Questions


1) Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

   Flex is one dimensional as it can control layout in a single direction either as a row or a column.


2) Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

   The main axis is determined by the flex direction. 
   If your flex direction is set to row the main axis is set to the row. 
   If your flex direction is set to column the main axis is set to column.
   The main axis will also affect how other flex properties such as justify-content and align-items effect the flex items.
  
  
3) How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
