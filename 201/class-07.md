### Domain Modelling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domian model can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.
it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can 
verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

##### Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

### HTML table basics

A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data).
When implemented correctly, HTML tables are handled well by accessibility tools such as screen readers, so a successful HTML table should enhance 
the experience of sighted and visually impaired users alike.

##### When should you NOT use HTML tables?
HTML tables should be used for tabular data â€” this is what they are designed for. Unfortunately, a lot of people used to use HTML tables to 
lay out web pages, e.g. one row to contain the header, one row to contain the content columns, one row to contain the footer, etc.
