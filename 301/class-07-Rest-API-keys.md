###### What does PUT do?

PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.


###### What does PATCH do?

The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
