# Run react locally with Vite

We can use vite to create a local react app.

This will make it a lot more primed for bundling and pushing to production if you want to deploy!

Vite will take care of the transpilation / compilation phase.

Will take our updated versions of JavaScript that we write and translate it to something that is more

widely supported amongst all major browsers.

Vite will also take care of the bundling.

Popular bundlers include Webpack, Parcel, Rollup, esbuild.

Webpack, Parcel, Rollup are all bundilng systems. 

esbuild will use a more updated way to use es modules and deploy something much faster.

Under the hood vite uses esbuild which gives vite a fast response time when you are developing locally.
